- **Tutorial:** 

## **Description:**

You are given an array of `k` linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

*Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it*.


## **Examples:**

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
- **Output:** [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
- **Explanation:**
    [
        1->4->5,
        1->3->4,
        2->6
    ]
    merging them into one sorted linked list:
        1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** lists = []
- **Output:** []

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** lists = [[]]
- **Output:** []


## **Constraints:**

- `k == lists.length`
- `0 <= k <= 104`
- `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
- `-104 <= lists[i][j] <= 104`
- `lists[i]` is sorted in **ascending order**.
- The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.


## **Simplified Explanation**:

First safely check if input is either none (`None`) or an empty list (`[]`). Merge the first 2 lists and append to mergedLists, then merge the next 1, or more, lists and append to mergedLists and so on. `mergedLists` becomes the new input `lists` and the process is repeated until all lists are merged into one linked list.
